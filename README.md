# Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Framework
Particle swarm optimization is a kind of swarm intelligence optimization algorithm. For more information about PSO, please refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization

This is the framework for working with particle swarm optimization with various algorithms, changeable structures and numerous benchmark functions.

To get start, you just need to type in codes like this in main function:

void runSDPSO(); //for running standard PSO
